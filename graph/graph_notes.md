1. “Graph” is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.  
2. There are many types of “graphs”. In this Explore Card, we will introduce three types of graphs: undirected graphs, directed graphs, and weighted graphs.  
3. Vertex: nodes are called vertices of the graph.
4. Edge: The connection between two vertices are the edges of the graph.
5. Path: the sequence of vertices to go through from one vertex to another.
**Note**: there can be multiple paths between two vertices.

6. Path Length: the number of edges in a path.
7. Cycle: a path where the starting point and endpoint are the same vertex.
8. Negative Weight Cycle: In a “weighted graph”, if the sum of the weights of all edges of a cycle is a negative value, it is a negative weight cycle. 
9. Connectivity: if there exists at least one path between two vertices, these two vertices are connected. 
10. Degree of a Vertex: the term “degree” applies to unweighted graphs. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connecting the vertex. 
11. In-Degree: “in-degree” is a concept in directed graphs. If the in-degree of a vertex is d, there are d directional edges incident to the vertex. 
12. Out-Degree: “out-degree” is a concept in directed graphs. If the out-degree of a vertex is d, there are d edges incident from the vertex.
